This code was put in to run a web app teleop. Note that it required an mjpeg server
to be started (check the history of android_teleop.launch).

It runs a pr2 teleop. Currently there is no setup for this in turtlebot. 
We would like to rethink web apps in a much more structured way going on towards hydra.
